## User experience
Users are generally excited about colors but a good user experience comes from a very carefully chosen set of colors - as you cannot have an application using only a color.

### How to choose colors
Colors are very important, as it gives the user direct and indirect feedback - see [this](https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#) short video to better understand how to choose colors for your applications.

### Colors palettes
A variety of color palettes can also be found [here](http://colorpalettes.net/). Those palettes are generally amazing because of the fact that the colors are chosen from real life scenarios like scenes or fruit alignment. Have a look below:

And keep in mind that these aren't the most spectacular ones. For more details check [this](https://alexandru.microsoft.pub.ro/2017/02/21/design-basics-with-xamarin/) blog above that talks about design Basics.
