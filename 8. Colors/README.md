Users are generally excited about colors but a good user experience comes from a very carefully chosen set of colors - as you cannot have an application using only a color.

### How to choose colors
Colors are very important, as it gives the user direct and indirect feedback - see [this](https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#) short video to better understand how to choose colors for your applications.

### Colors pallets
A variety of color pallets can also be found [here](http://colorpalettes.net/). Those pallets are generally amazing because of the fact that the colors are choose from real life scenarios like scenes or fruits alignment. Have a look bellow:
