This module focuses primarily on what is **user interface** and what is the difference between that and **user experience**.

  

  

##  User interface

  

An application is mainly built from __two main parts__: the **back-end** (which holds how the information is being changed in methods and in certain cases) and the **user interface** (that displays the information to the user). Of course, the database is a third part of an application but it is merely integrated in the back-end because it stores data.

  

  

User interface refers (as the term is also suggesting) the interface of an application which the user interacts with - the visual part of the project.

  

  

##  User experience

  

There may be discussions about the paradigm, the technology used, libraries and design patterns but we can all agree that one thing will always be mandatory to be discussed: User Experience (UX).

  

Often people confuse UI with UX - user experience - action that cannot be more wrong and this is why:

  

- When discussing user experience, people often think that it describes what the final product looks like, how easily specific lists or pages can be reached and especially how pleasing it is to the user;

  

- That is what the "user interface" (UI) term means, whereas User experience involves user the interface but doesn’t  consist  only  from  this,  just  like  a  final product doesn’t consist of only the front-end part of the application.

  

- User experience applies mainly to a person’s endangerment using a product, this consisting of both the user interface but more importantly of the performances of the application, how adaptable it is to _big data_ but also which _environment variables are relevant_ and which are not.

  

  

###  UX vs UI

  

The following parallel describes what elements create the user experience and what can be derived from the user interface, also explaining the difference between these two concepts.

As you can see, all the _business analysis_, _user # researchability_ and various discovered _scenarios_ come around together and define User experience, whereas from the User interfaces can be understood and pointed out elements such as the _visual design_ - how the application is suppose to look like, the colors and _layouts_ (about which we will be talk about in a further module) and what the _graphic designers' work_ is combined for.

  

  

####  If you are still not sure what is the difference, then please see the bellow real scenario that explains the difference:
